Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)
Frontend is the part of the web application that users see and interact with. It runs in the browser and focuses on user experience.
1.User Interface (UI)
Frontend is responsible for designing and displaying the layout of the website. This includes buttons, forms, text, images, menus, and all visual elements. It makes sure the app looks clean, readable, and easy to use.
2.User Interaction
Frontend handles all user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling, and navigating pages. For example, when a user clicks “Login” or types in a search box, frontend code handles that action.
3.Communication with Backend
Frontend sends requests to the backend and receives responses. For example, when a user submits a login form, frontend sends the data to the backend and then shows the success or error message based on the response.

Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
Backend is the brain of the application. It works behind the scenes and handles all the logic, data, and security.
1.Server-side Processing
Backend processes user requests. For example, when a user logs in, backend checks the credentials and decides whether access should be given or not.
2.Database Handling
Backend connects to the database to store, fetch, update, or delete data. For example, saving user details, fetching product lists, or updating order status.
3.Security and Authentication
Backend handles login, signup, password encryption, and access control. It makes sure only authorized users can access certain data or features.

Q3. Business Logic
Business logic is the rules and decision-making part of an application. It decides what should happen in different situations based on the business requirements.
In simple words, business logic is:
“If this happens, then do this.”
Real-world Examples:
 (i)E-commerce Website(If cart total is above ₹1000, apply 10% discount.)
(ii)Banking App(If OTP is wrong, don’t allow login)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. Client–Server Model
The client–server model is a way to structure communication in a web application.
Who is the Client?
The client is the user’s device or browser (like Chrome, Edge, mobile app). It sends requests and shows responses.
Who is the Server?
The server is a computer/system that processes requests, runs backend code, and sends data back.
How Communication Happens
Client sends a request (for example: login, fetch data).
Server processes it.
Server sends response (success, data, error).
Client shows the result to the user.
This happens using HTTP/HTTPS.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three layers. This makes the system clean, organized, and easy to maintain.
1.Presentation Layer
This is the Frontend.
It handles UI and user interaction.
Example: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
2.Application (Business) Layer
This is the Backend logic layer.
It processes requests, applies business logic, and decides what to do.
Example: Node.js, Java, Spring Boot.
3.Data Layer
This is the Database layer.
It stores and manages data.
Example: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

(i)Why 3-Tier Architecture is Used
.Easy to manage
.Better security
.Easy to scale
.Clear separation of responsibilities

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language
JavaScript is not only for frontend. It is widely used for backend too, mainly with Node.js.
1.Performance
JavaScript (Node.js) is fast and handles multiple requests efficiently using non-blocking I/O. This makes it good for real-time apps like chat apps.
2.Ecosystem
JavaScript has a huge ecosystem with npm. You get thousands of libraries for authentication, database, security, payments, etc.
3.Popular Backend Frameworks
Express.js – simple and widely used
NestJS – structured and powerful
Fastify – high performance
(i)Why Companies Like It
.Same language for frontend and backend
.Faster development
.Large community support
